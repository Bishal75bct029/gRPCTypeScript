I was about to work on gRPC project on my work. So, I did this warm up task to know how gRPC works.
If you want to take reference from this project, you can clone it and start rest and gRPC server individually.
Then go to the postman or browser and hit base url http://localhost:3000. You will find out the data provided by gRPC server.
